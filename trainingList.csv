1,SCENE 1: The Trouble With Swallows
2,ARTHUR: Whoa there!
3,SOLDIER #1: Halt! Who goes there?
4,"ARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons, Sovereign of all England!"
5,SOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!
6,"ARTHUR: I am, and this is my trusty servant Patsy."
7,We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.
8,I must speak with your lord and master.
9,SOLDIER #1: What?
10,Ridden on a horse?
11,ARTHUR: Yes!
12,SOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts!
13,ARTHUR: What?
14,SOLDIER #1: You've got two empty halves of a coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.
15,ARTHUR: So?
16,"We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercia, through--"
17,SOLDIER #1: Where'd you get the coconuts?
18,ARTHUR: We found them.
19,SOLDIER #1: Found them?
20,In Mercia?
21,The coconut's tropical!
22,ARTHUR: What do you mean?
23,"SOLDIER #1: Well, this is a temperate zone."
24,"ARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?"
25,SOLDIER #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
26,Not at all.
27,They could be carried.
28,SOLDIER #1: What?
29,A swallow carrying a coconut?
30,ARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk
31,SOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it!
32,It's a simple question of weight ratios!
33,A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.
34,"ARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter."
35,Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here?
36,SOLDIER #1: Listen.
37,"In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?"
38,ARTHUR: Please!
39,SOLDIER #1: Am I right?
40,ARTHUR: I'm not interested!
41,SOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!
42,"SOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow."
43,That's my point.
44,"SOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that."
45,ARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!
46,"SOLDIER #1: But then of course, uh, African swallows are non-migratory."
47,"SOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah."
48,"SOLDIER #1: So, they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway."
49,SOLDIER #2: Wait a minute!
50,Supposing two swallows carried it together?
51,"SOLDIER #1: No, they'd have to have it on a line."
52,"SOLDIER #2: Well, simple! They'd just use a strand of creeper!"
53,"SOLDIER #1: What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?"
54,"SOLDIER #2: Well, why not?"

123,"DENNIS: Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?"
124,"ARTHUR: I did say 'sorry' about the 'old woman', but from the behind you looked--"
125,DENNIS: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior!
126,"ARTHUR: Well, I am King!"
127,"DENNIS: Oh, King, eh, very nice."
128,"And how d'you get that, eh?"
129,By exploiting the workers?
130,By 'anging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society?
131,If there's ever going to be any progress with the--
132,"WOMAN: Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here."

141,"We are all Britons, and I am your king."
142,WOMAN: I didn't know we had a king.
143,I thought we were an autonomous collective.
144,DENNIS: You're fooling yourself.
145,"We're living in a dictatorship, a self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--"
146,"WOMAN: Oh, there you go bringing class into it again."
147,DENNIS: That's what it's all about.
148,If only people would hear of--
149,"ARTHUR: Please! Please, good people."
150,I am in haste.
151,Who lives in that castle?
152,WOMAN: No one lives there.
153,ARTHUR: Then who is your lord?
154,WOMAN: We don't have a lord.
155,ARTHUR: What?
156,DENNIS: I told you.
157,We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.
158,"We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week,..."
159,ARTHUR: Yes.
160,DENNIS: ...but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting...

173,"WOMAN: Well, how did you become King, then?"
174,"ARTHUR: The Lady of the Lake,..."
175,"...her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur."
176,That is why I am your king!
177,DENNIS: Listen.
178,Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.
179,"Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony."
180,ARTHUR: Be quiet!
181,"DENNIS: Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!"
182,ARTHUR: Shut up!
183,"DENNIS: I mean, if I went 'round saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!"

186,"DENNIS: Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system."

193,ARTHUR: Bloody peasant!
194,"DENNIS: Oh, what a give-away."
195,"Did you hear that? Did you hear that, eh?"
196,That's what I'm on about.

448,ARTHUR: What is your name?
449,"BEDEVERE: 'Bedevere', my liege."

451,
452,"NARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow:"
453,"Sir Lancelot the Brave,"
454,"Sir Gallahad the Pure,"
455,"and Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot,"
456,"who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor,"
457,"who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol,"
458,"and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill,"
459,and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.
460,Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: The Knights of the Round Table.
461,SCENE 6: Camelot is a Silly Place
462,"SIR BEDEVERE: And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped."
463,"ARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere."
464,Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
465,"BEDEVERE: Oh, certainly, sir."
466,"SIR LANCELOT: Look, my liege!"

468,SIR GALAHAD: Camelot!
469,LANCELOT: Camelot!
470,PATSY: It's only a model.
471,"ARTHUR: Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home."
472,Let us ride... to... Camelot!
473,KNIGHTS: [singing] We're Knights of the Round Table.
474,We dance whene'er we're able.
475,We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable.
476,We dine well here in Camelot.
477,We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.
478,We're Knights of the Round Table.
479,"Our shows are formidable,"
480,But many times we're given rhymes That are quite unsingable.
481,We're opera mad in Camelot.
482,We sing from the diaphragm a lot.
483,PRISONER: [clap clap clap clap]
484,"KNIGHTS: [tap-dancing] In war we're tough and able,"

486,Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.
487,It's a busy life in Camelot.
488,MAN: I have to push the pram a lot.
489,"ARTHUR: Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot."
490,It is a silly place.

492,SCENE 7: God Gives Arthur a Stern Talking To
493,GOD: Arthur!
494,"Arthur, King of the Britons!"

496,"One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling."
497,ARTHUR: Sorry.
498,GOD: And don't apologize.
499,Every time I try to talk to someone it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'.
500,What are you doing now?!
501,"ARTHUR: I'm averting my eyes, O Lord."
502,"GOD: Well, don't."
503,It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so depressing.

737,"We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us."

825,"Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot."
826,"Oh, she is a naughty person and she must pay the penalty,"
827,"and here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon:"
828,you must tie her down on a bed and spank her.
829,GIRLS: A spanking!
830,A spanking!
831,"DINGO: You must spank her well, and after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like,"
832,"and then, spank me."
833,AMAZING: And spank me.
834,STUNNER: And me.
835,LOVELY: And me.
836,DINGO: Yes.

864,GIRLS: Yes!
865,Let him tackle us single-handed!
866,"LANCELOT: No, Sir Galahad. Come on!"
867,GALAHAD: No!
868,Really!

888,You were in great peril.
889,GALAHAD: I don't think I was.
890,"LANCELOT: Yes, you were."
891,You were in terrible peril.
892,"GALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril."
893,"LANCELOT: No, it's too perilous."
894,"GALAHAD: Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can."
895,"LANCELOT: No, we've got to find the Holy Grail."
896,Come on!
897,"GALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?"
898,LANCELOT: No.
899,It's unhealthy.
900,GALAHAD: I bet you're gay.
901,"LANCELOT: No, I'm not."
902,
903,"NARRATOR: Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail."
904,"Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something."
905,"Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously."
906,"I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away--"
907,"four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them."
908,"I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--"
909,CROWD: Get on with it!
910,"NARRATOR: Oh, anyway."
911,"On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue,"

925,"He knows of a cave, a cave which no man has entered."
926,ARTHUR: And the Grail.
927,The Grail is there?
928,"OLD MAN: There is much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed."
929,ARTHUR: But the Grail!
930,Where is the Grail?!
931,OLD MAN: Seek you the Bridge of Death.

1011,"FATHER: One day, lad, all this will be yours!"
1012,"PRINCE HERBERT: What, the curtains?"
1013,FATHER: No.
1014,"Not the curtains, lad."
1015,"All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land!"
1016,"This'll be your kingdom, lad."
1017,HERBERT: But Mother--
1018,"FATHER: Father, lad."
1019,Father.
1020,"HERBERT: B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that."
1021,"FATHER: Listen, lad."
1022,I built this kingdom up from nothing.
1023,"When I started here, all there was was swamp. Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em."
1024,It sank into the swamp.
1025,"So, I built a second one."
1026,That sank into the swamp.
1027,"So, I built a third one."
1028,"That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp, but the fourth one... stayed up!"
1029,"And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands."
1030,HERBERT: But I don't want any of that. I'd rather--
1031,FATHER: Rather what?!
1032,HERBERT: I'd rather...
1033,...just... sing!
1034,FATHER: Stop that!
1035,Stop that!
1036,You're not going into a song while I'm here.
1037,"Now listen, lad."
1038,"In twenty minutes, you're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain."
1039,HERBERT: B-- but I don't want land.
1040,"FATHER: Listen, Alice,--"
1041,HERBERT: Herbert.
1042,FATHER: 'Erbert.
1043,We live in a bloody swamp.
1044,We need all the land we can get.
1045,HERBERT: But-- but I don't like her.
1046,FATHER: Don't like her?!
1047,What's wrong with her?!
1048,She's beautiful.
1049,She's rich.
1050,She's got huge... tracts o' land!
1051,"HERBERT: I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to have... [music] ...a certain,... special... something!"
1052,FATHER: Cut that out!
1053,Cut that out!
1054,"Look, you're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea! [smack]"
1055,Guards! Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
1056,GUARD #1: Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.

1060,"GUARD #1: Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room."
1061,"FATHER: No, no, no."
1062,You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
1063,GUARD #1: And you'll come and get him.
1064,GUARD #2: Hic!
1065,FATHER: Right.
1066,GUARD #1: We don't need to do anything apart from just stop him entering the room.
1067,"FATHER: No, no leaving the room."
1068,GUARD #1: Leaving the room.
1069,Yes. [sniff]
1070,FATHER: All right?

1075,FATHER: Yes?
1076,What is it?
1077,"GUARD #1: Oh, i-- if-- i-- oh--"
1078,"FATHER: Look, it's quite simple."
1079,GUARD #1: Uh...
1080,FATHER: You just stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave the room.
1081,All right?
1082,GUARD #2: Hic!
1083,FATHER: Right.
1084,"GUARD #1: Oh, I remember."
1085,"Uhh, can he leave the room with us?"
1086,"FATHER: N-- no, no."
1087,"No, you just keep him in here and make sure he--"
1088,"GUARD #1: Oh, yes."
1089,"We'll keep him in here, obviously, but if he had to leave and we were with him--"
1090,"FATHER: No, no, no, no."

1105,FATHER: Make sure 'e doesn't leave.
1106,GUARD #1: The Prince?
1107,FATHER: Yes. Make sure 'e doesn't leave.
1108,"GUARD #1: Oh, yes, of course."
1109,GUARD #2: Hic!
1110,GUARD #1: Ah. I thought you meant him.
1111,"You know, it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard."
1112,FATHER: Is that clear?
1113,GUARD #2: Hic!
1114,"GUARD #1: Oh, quite clear."
1115,No problems.

1293,FATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father--
1294,GUEST #2: He's getting better!

1296,BRIDE'S FATHER: Uugh!
1297,"GUEST #2: Oh, he's died!"
1298,"FATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad, in a very real and legally binding sense. [clap clap clap]"
1299,"And I feel sure that the merger-- er, the union between the Princess and the brave, but dangerous, Sir Lancelot of Camelot--"
1300,LANCELOT: What?

1334,It's not right for my idiom!
1335,GUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell about his great escape...
1336,LANCELOT: I must escape more... [sigh]
1337,"GUESTS: [singing] Oh, he fell a long, long way,..."
1338,"CONCORDE: Dramatically, sir?"
